This package contains the classes use to create a service according to 
the definition given in the <i><b>B</b>asic <b>I</b>nterconnexion <b>P</b>rotocol</i> (BIP).
A service BIP implies a registration to DNS-SD, and the creation of a TCP service for the service control.
This package contains also classes to discover service, and to do queries to the control port.
</P>
<P>
The registration to DNS-SD enables to discover this service.
The service are registered to DNS-SD with the type "_bip._tcp".
The control port enables to obtain a description of the service through the list 
of its inputs, its outputs and its variables.
</P>

<P><b>How to create a service ?</b></P>
<P>
To create a service, the user must extend one of these two classes:
<ul><li>ControlServer
</li><li>ServiceFromXml
</li></ul>
The second creates a ControlServer and then load a XML description that contains 
data about variables, input and output. These data are for example name, description.
</P>
<P>
The methods that can need to be reimplemented are modifVariable and connect called to answer queries
about a modification of a variable or a connection to do.
</P>
<P>
The item of a service : variable, input, output are manipulated through the 
classes VariableAttribut, and InOutputAttribut;
</P>

<P><b>How to find a service ?</b></P>
<P>
The class BrowseForService enables to list the service registered on DNS-SD with a given type.
</P>
<P>
The class WaitForBipService enables to find a particular service registered on DNS-SD with the type "_bip._tcp".
</P>

<P><b>How to question a service ?</b></P>
<P>To interact with the control port, there is the class ControlClient.
It enables to send query, then it waits for answer, and parses it.
With BIP, the peer mus be identified by an identifier, 
it can be obtained by using the static method BipService.GenerateServiceId.
</P>
<P>
Note : A good way to obtain a ControlClient instance for a service is to 
used the class BipService, and call the method initControlClient.
</P>

<P><i>See the description of each class for more information.</i></P>
