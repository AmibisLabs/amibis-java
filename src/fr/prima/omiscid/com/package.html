This package contains the class use to exchange messages according to the

<P>
<ul>
<li>TcpServer and TcpClient enable to exhange message over TCP.
</li><li>Message is used to contains the exchanged messages.

<b>Some information about BIP for the message exchange :</b>
</P>
<P>
Data that transits over any link with service obeys the following message format.
Messages are the lowest-level of the protocol, i.e. what transits over a network
connection to a service. They contain a fixed-size (34 bytes) header and a
variable-size payload; the header is the concatenation of the following ASCII
strings:
<ol>
<li> Magic header (7 bytes). It is a string of the form ``BIP/X.Y``, where ``X``
   is the major version of the protocol, ``Y`` is the minor version.
   Currently all services should use ``BIP/1.0``.
</li>
<li> Space (1 byte).
</li>
<li> Peer identifier (8 bytes). A unique identifier for the peer that emitted the
   message. It represents a 32-bit unsigned integer formatted as hex. 
   
   For peers that are services, the first 16 bits may represent the service
   startup time in seconds since the UNIX epoch, modulo 65536, and the last 16
   bits may be randomly chosen.
</li>   
<li> Space (1 byte).
</li>
<li> Message identifier (8 bytes). A message identifier that is unique for the
   (simplex) link. It represents a 32-bit unsigned integer formatted
   as hex. It is incremented for each sent message and starts from 0. The
   message identifier 0 is used during the link establishment process.
</li>   
<li> Space (1 byte).
</li>
<li> Payload size (8 bytes). The number of bytes in the message contents. It
   represents a 32-bit integer formatted as hex.
</li>
</ol>
</P>

<P>   
Both the header and the payload are immediately followed by the ``&lt;cr&gt;``
carriage-return plus ``&lt;lf&gt;`` line-feed line termination sequence (bytes
``0x0A`` and ``0x0D``), which are not taken into account for length
calculations. In the case of an empty payload (length zero), the termination
sequence must still be appended; in other words, the message end with two
successive ``&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;`` sequences.
</P>

<P>
Example message :
<ul> <li>BIP/1.0 A47F64A1 00000000 0000000&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;
</li><li>BIP/1.0 A47F64A1 00000000 000000D&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;hello, world!&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;
</ul>
</P>

<P>
A service accepts TCP link on one TCP port for control links, and one TCP port
for each input and output. For inputs, it also accepts messages over UDP if a
TCP link has been established (see below). For outputs, it can emit over UDP if
requested. To establish the link, after the opening of the TCP connection, an empty message is exchanged.
