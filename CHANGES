*must: big constants are properly generated under dnssd but not properly read
*must: solve the castor proliferation problem
*must: find and kill all "< (that is manually generated xml)
*Q: how is reflected in the dnssd txt record the fact that a connector has an udp port?
*should: do not query full description before needed
*should: review, optimize and make safer the queries present under ServiceProxy (e.g. 2 queries are done to get a service global description)
*should: make configurable (through Java and C++) the timeout for control queries
*could: dnssd client auto connect/reconnect
*could: dnssd client has a list of expected servers


1.1.1
r

        fix:  problem with jmdns and big txt records (services with many variables)

r2441
        fix:  default "class" variable value is now "Service" as intended
        fix:  getting a remote variable now properly ask the remote service (wrong caching policy)
        fix:  service xml description now uses proper castor version
        fix:  added a try catch around listener callbacks (was trusting listeners) (connector and variable listeners)
        fix:  listener added before connectTo are now properly listening
        fix:  connectors peer id where wrongly generated in some cases
        impr: (API) minor change adding a ConnectionRefused exception on Service#connectTo

        impr: (API) added Service#sendReplyToMessage methods
        impr: sensible performance improvement on high bandwidth message receptions
        impr: performance improvement on Service initialisation
        impr: have different options to access dnssd (mdnsResponder, avahi, jmdns, custom proxy for lightweight devices)
        impr: added a default factory that smartly uses available dnssd provider (avahi then mdns then jmdns)
        impr: allows dnssd browser sharing to improve performance of applications using multiple browsers
        impr: cleaner affectation of peer id for searchs and connections before .start()
        impr: in order to handle mDNSResponder vs avahi daemons conflict happening on some configurations, the possible trailing "-2" on the hostname is removed when needed
        impr: Utility class will now be accessible from OSGi and now contains a shortcut Utility.message(String) to Utility.stringToByteArray()

        impr: made some exceptions RuntimeException
        fix:  removed some more synchronization to allow to findService while doing other operations
