howto run tests (easily and sequentially)
  good question



Maven only and Pure Java only:
* scope: jOMiSCID-Maven
* NO (this runs the tests ...) "clean and build"
* "test" then wait and check tests are passing
* set proper version (e.g. 1.6.0) in pom.xml
* change release.conf with proper version number
* mvn -Prelease -Dmaven.test.skip=true deploy
* ! check the CHANGES file is correct (clean + version number + revision number)
* make -f release.mk
* can do a "make -f release.mk release-package-upload" in addition if you want to publish on oberon 
* ! then change version numbers (pom to -SNAPSHOT and e.g. to a minor version 1.6.0.12 (4 numbers) in release.conf)
* get the bordel back to CHANGES
* commit as a post version

Maven only and netbeans module only:
* scope: jOMiSCID-Maven-Netbeans
* mvn clean install deploy
* cp target/fr-prima-netbeans-omiscid-*.nbm /home/oberon/public-nbms/
