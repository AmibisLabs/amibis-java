howto run tests (easily and sequentially)
  good question



Maven only and Pure Java only:
* scope: jOMiSCID-Maven
* "clean and build"
* "test" then wait and check tests are passing
* set proper version (e.g. 1.6.0) in pom.xml
* mvn -Prelease -Dmaven.test.skip=true deploy
* ! then change version number (e.g. to a minor version 1.6.0.12 (4 numbers))
* ! check the CHANGES file is correct (clean + version number + revision number)
* change release.conf with proper version number
* make -f release.mk
* 

Maven only and netbeans module only:
* scope: jOMiSCID-Netbeans
* build
* deploy
* scp -r output-repository/* oberon:/var/www/release/maven
